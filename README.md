# AI-Driven Disaster Response Coordination Tool

## Project Description

This project is an AI-driven platform designed to enhance disaster response efforts through real-time analysis of satellite images, social media data (tweets), and weather information. The system predicts disaster severity and urgency, enabling quicker and more effective decision-making for emergency responders.

## Problem Solved

Natural disasters pose significant threats to lives and infrastructure, requiring swift and accurate response efforts. Our tool helps decision-makers analyze large datasets (satellite images, tweets, and weather data) to understand disaster severity and provide actionable insights. This allows for more timely interventions and better resource allocation.

## Features

- **Disaster Severity Prediction**: Machine learning models to assess the severity of natural disasters using satellite images and weather data.
- **Sentiment and Urgency Analysis**: Analysis of tweets related to disasters to gauge public sentiment and urgency using NLP (Natural Language Processing).
- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Processing real-time weather data to provide accurate information for decision-makers during disasters.
- **Visualization**: Interactive data visualizations to help users understand disaster severity and response needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for data processing and model building.
- **Dash/StreamLit**: For building the web app interface.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive data visualizations.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For disaster severity prediction using deep learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For sentiment analysis on social media data.
- **APIs**: Integration with real-time weather APIs.
